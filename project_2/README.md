Title: Pokemon Black Market

Summary:
Welcome to the Pokemon Black Market, a place where a user can view our complete inventory of both normal and shiny pokemon for purchase. 

To view pokemon:
One way a user can search their Pokemon of choice via the search bar, start typing and 10 suggestions will pre-load and are able to be clicked on to view various details of your pokemon. Another way to view pokemon is in the default home page. It will show 20 pokemon at a time, with next and previous buttons at the bottom to continue or go back to previously loaded. You will also notice on the navigation bar that their is a button to toggle the shiny versions of the pokemon. This functionality continues in the details pages. 

Pokemon details:
Each Pokemon card will have a different background based on their main type and in the details page their moves/abilities will have the same functionality to show you what type that move/ability is. Users can add their selected pokemon to cart and/or favorites page. 

To checkout:
You can add your pokemon to the cart and or favorites buttons using the buttons located in both the home page and details page, you can also use the remove buttons to remove from the previously discussed lists. To view your cart click on the grocery cart on the top right hand side of the screen. To view your favorites, select the heart on the top right. When in your cart you can remove whatever is incorrect and view your total. Once you're ready to checkout simply click on the checkout button and a checkout page will be displayed.


Important Developer Notes:

To edit our Application please ensure the following are installed via your terminal:

npm install react
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install bootstrap
npm install react-animated-text


The vast majority of functions and useStates will be in the 'DetailContext.js'. Specific funtions and useState pertaining to their perticular components will be found within their components. 

Most CSS work has been done within the compenents themselves, with an archive of Pokemon Type backgrounds can be found in App.css.a

Important considerations: 

While this application is fully functional, all components, useStates, functions, methods, variables, and code in general have been written by students of Galvanize and thus is probably not written the most efficiently. If you have problems, blame our instructors. Pictures of one of our instructors can be found in the checkout page. ;)
